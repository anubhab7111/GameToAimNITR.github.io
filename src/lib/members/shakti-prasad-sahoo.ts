  bio: "I’m a student who enjoys learning new things and working on personal growth. I like to stick to traditional values but also keep an open mind about the future. I’m curious, “hardworking” (depending on the day 😄), and always ready to take on new challenges, whether it’s studies or something creative, I try to give my best and keep improving with time.",
