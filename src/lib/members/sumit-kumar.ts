  bio: "I'm Sumit Kumar, a passionate game developer and core member of the GTA (Game To Him) club at NIT Rourkela. I love creating immersive experiences using Unity, Blender, and Unreal Engine, and have worked on projects ranging from VR zombie shooters to open-world GTA-style games. I've represented the club at national-level game jams and tech fests, and thrive on building everything from scratch—code, mechanics, and models. Game dev for me is not just about fun—it's about storytelling, design, and pure creativity.",
