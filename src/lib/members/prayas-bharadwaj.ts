  bio: "I’m a curious storm in constant motion. I chase depth, not for perfection, but because I can’t help it. I oscillate between obsession and laughter like it’s natural. I question everything, including myself, and enjoy the paradox. I don’t know exactly what I am — but whatever it is, it’s intentional.",
