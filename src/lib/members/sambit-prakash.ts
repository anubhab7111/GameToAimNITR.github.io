  bio: "As a 3D designer, I specialize in creating detailed and precise models using SolidWorks and Blender. With SolidWorks, I focus on mechanical and industrial designs, delivering production-ready CAD models and assemblies. Blender allows me to explore the creative sideâ€”crafting realistic renders, animations, and organic modeling. I have mastered surface modeling, simulation setups, and rendering workflows. My designs are driven by both functionality and aesthetics. I adapt easily to new challenges, from product design to visual storytelling.",
